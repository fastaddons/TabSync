# Privacy Policy
TLDR: I'm doing my best to procet your data from 3rd parties. I don't collect any users data, no history, no statistics, no ads.

TabSync Pro doesn't collect any data.  
It features user tabs synchronization. This is used to synchronize Tabs of user browser to the cloud server, and from there to other devices/browsers of the user.  
Server is hosted at professional VPS provider Tilaa.com in Nederlands.  
All users data (Tabs data) send to server are transfered through encrypted HTTPS connections.  
Only author of this extension (Juraj MÃ¤siar) has access to the cloud server.  
If you delete your account, all your data will be forever gone from the server.  
Server is automatically updated with security patches and manually upgraded when OS LTS update is available.
